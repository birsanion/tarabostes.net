            Supporting initiatives and causes we believe in has always been high up on our list. As we’ve grown, we realized we could do an even better job at it. That’s how SNAC Foundation was born. It’s our way of giving back to the community.

            From 2008 until now we have developed the largest volunteer network in Romania and the only one in Europe at national level. With over 60,000 volunteers nationwide, teachers and students, we conduct volunteer activities for abandoned children, the elderly and people with special needs.

            The world is complicated enough, so we’re keeping this simple. Every year, we will donate 1% of our profits to good causes. The Foundation Committee, consisting of Infinum’s employees, votes and allocates the funds and resources through sponsorships, education, fundraising and volunteering.

            For the time being, our focus are projects involving children and young people. Why? We believe that future generations can create an enormous impact when given the right knowledge and tools.

            An institution for the placement and care of children without parents has been active for over 50 years, and has helped thousands of children. We donated books, computers, didactic toys, and a bunch of gift cards for the kids.

            This project aims to bring this tool to more than 400 educational institutions with children special needs around Romania.
