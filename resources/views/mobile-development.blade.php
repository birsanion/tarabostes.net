            Each have their own strength and weaknesses that are important to understand when choosing between them:

              Native apps
            </strong>
          </h5>
          <h6>
            A native application is a mobile app built for a specific software operating system, such as Android or iOS. Native applications need to be downloaded onto the device, usually from an app store provided by the operating system. Being downloaded onto the device allows the native application to take advantage of the device’s hardware features, such as its camera, microphone, Bluetooth and so on.
          </h6>
          <h6>
            The main objective of a native app is to make sure it delivers the best performance for its users. As a result, these applications boast good user interfaces, performance and consistency. They also tend to work offline. By developing an application this way, our teams can work directly with the native OS features without being behind an abstraction layer.
          </h6>
          <h6>
            Due to the ease of accessibility, native applications have higher user engagement compared to other types of mobile applications. However, in most cases, a different version of the application will need to be created and maintained for each platform.

            <strong>
              Web apps
            </strong>
          </h5>
          <h6>
            A web app is a software application that’s stored on the internet and can be accessed via a web browser, rather than having to be downloaded onto a physical device from an app store. Because of this, they can run on multiple platforms as long as the web browser installed on the device is compatible. Web apps are designed to be responsive with a mobile-first approach, and their main benefit is that they’re cheaper to build than native and hybrid apps – not only because the cost of hiring a web developer is cheaper than hiring multiple native app developers, but also because web apps are cross-platform. This means that the app only needs to be written once, and will work across different devices regardless of the operating system. However, it can compromise on performance, as web apps won’t be able to speak directly to the operating system or device hardware, maximising on the features and functionality of the device.
          </h6>
          <h5 class="mt-5 section-title">
            <strong>
              Hybrid apps
            </strong>
          </h5>
          <h6>
            A hybrid app combines native and web app features. It does this by embedding a web browser into a native app, allowing the app to be built using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, while also allowing the app to be downloaded from an app store. This means it appears just like a native app, and also has the ability to take advantage of device hardware features ,such as camera, geolocation, storage and other hardware components. However, they’re usually slower, as they aren’t optimised for specific platforms.
          </h6>
          <h6>
            There are several frameworks for building cross-platform apps; some allow for specific web technologies, others have better online communities and some double down on the performance of the end result. Whichever you choose, Tarabostes software can support your need for  Flutter or React Native builds that help you deliver to market as soon as possible.
