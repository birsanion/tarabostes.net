            Gartner's Blockchain technology report suggests that blockchain will generate an annual business value of more than US $3 trillion by 2030 as 10% to 20% of global economic infrastructure will be running on blockchain-based systems. In addition, blockchain enables organisations to code multiple aspects, including data privacy, governance, identity management and more.

          <h6><strong>Validated transactions:</strong> Data stored in the blockchain is immutable and cannot be changed easily, as the data added to the block after approval allows secure transactions.<h6>
          <h6><strong>Decentralisation:</strong> Blockchain ledger provides complete visibility on transactions. Furthermore, it is a decentralised network, giving no central authority to anyone. </h6>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
          </div>
          <h6><strong>Improved transparency:</strong> With blockchain, organisations can go for a completely decentralised network where there is no need for a central authority, improving the systemâ€™s transparency.<h6>
          <h6><strong>Enhanced security:</strong> Security is also enhanced as each node holds a copy of the transactions, failing any malicious attempts to make changes in the transaction.</h6>
          <h6><strong>Improved traceability:</strong> As the supply chain becomes more transparent, it enables better traceability. Organisations can also make the most out of blockchain traceability by implementing it in-house.</h6>
