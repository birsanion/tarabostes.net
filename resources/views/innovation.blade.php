              Innovation through insight and ideas
            </strong>

          <h6>
            We'll draw on experience, insight and technology advancement to uncover new answers to business challenges, create market advantage and unlock opportunities for your company.

          <h6>
            Original ideas are informed by creativity, data and our collective digital obsessions. Our innovation doesnâ€™t always lead to products and can be as much about testing and creating concepts. Whether it's trialling new hardware to deliver previously elusive solutions or a design sprint to solve a specific challenge, we'll keep pushing the boundaries.
          </h6>

            Previous innovation projects range from research in special psychopedagogy to the creation of working tools, web and mobile applications for psychologists, speech therapists, the creation of a mobile application for interconnecting people with disabilities with universities and companies for professional development.
